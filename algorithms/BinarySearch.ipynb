    "# Binary Search\n",
    "Binary search, also known as logarithmic search, is a searching algorithm that finds a target value in sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search innterval by half. It's very important to note that the Binary Search algorithm only works provided the list/array is sorted.  \n",
    "This searching algorithm is quite superior to linear search in terms of time complexity and space complexity.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic behind this searching algorithm is very simple;  \n",
    "Given a sorted array, intervally begin with the mid element,<br>\n",
    "If the element to be found is equal to the mid element, then return the index of the mid element,<br>\n",
    "Or if the element to be found is less than the mid element of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half.  \n",
    "Else, narrow it to the upper half.  \n",
    "This process is done iteratively or recursively until the element is found or the interval is empty.<br>  \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be implementing the iterative method of binary search, as well as the recursive method of binary search.  \n",
    "Also, I will implement a linear search just to compare the time taken for executing both search algorithms.  \n",
    "Let's get to it...."
