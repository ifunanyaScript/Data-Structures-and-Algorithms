    "# Merge Sort\n",
    "Merge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that follows the divide and conquer method.  \n",
    "In this algorithm, an array is split into two sub-arrays, then this sub-arrays __if sorted__ are merged by comparing the values in each array and placing then appropriately in a new array such that this new array is sorted and contains all the values in the previous sub-arrays.<br>  \n",
    "In the previous paragraph, I mentioned that the two sub-arrays can only be merged if they're each sorted. Since we are splitting an initial array into two  \n",
    "sub-arrays, there is no way to ascertain that the sub-arrays yielded from this splitting will be each sorted; Now that is what I call a quandary.<br>  \n",
    "To solve the quandary of uncertainty, the initial array is recursively split, such that the sub-arrays are also split and the sub-arrays after them,  \n",
    "until the point where the recursive split cannot be executed. At this point, the sub-arrays now contain only a single value/element,  \n",
    "and an array containing only one element is effectively sorted. Viola!!!<br>  \n",
    "When the sorted sub-arrays have been actualised, the merging is executed recursively, from the recursion stack of the splitting operation. The merging operation is done by simply comparing the first value/element of the __sorted__ sub-arrays and placing then in a new array, such that the new array remains sorted in an ascending fashion.<br>  \n",
    "Big (O) complexity of Merge Sort:  \n",
    "Time complexity, divide(split) and conquer(merge) __O(nlogn)__  \n",
    "Space complexity, optimised __O(1)__<br>  \n",
    "Now, I'll write the recursive function for merge sort. Let's get to it..."
