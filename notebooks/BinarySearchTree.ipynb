    "# Binary Search Tree\n",
    "A binary tree is a Tree data structure with a constraint that each node can bear at most, two children. Since each node in a binary tree can have two children at most, we typically name these children, __left child__ and __right child__.<br>\n",
    "A Binary Search Tree(BST) is just a sorted binary tree data structure.\n",
    "This sorting is done such that:<br>\n",
    "The left subtree(child) of a node only contains nodes with keys less than the node's key.<br>\n",
    "The right subtree(child) of a node only contains nodes with keys greater than the node's key.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The Binary Tree consist of the following:<br>\n",
    "__Node__: Each vertex of the binary tree is a node.<br>\n",
    "__Root__: Topmost node of the binary tree.<br>\n",
    "__Edge__: Connecting link between a parent node and a child node.<br>\n",
    "__Parent Node__: The node having an edge sharing to a left _and/or_ right child.<br>\n",
    "__Child Node__:\tAny of the left or right sub nodes of a parent node.<br>\n",
    "__Leaf__: The last node which does not have any sub node(children) is the leaf node.<br>  \n",
    "\n",
    "__NB:__ Big O time complexity of a Binary Tree;  \n",
    "Insertion of a node is __O(logn)__,<br>\n",
    "Deletion of a node is __O(logn)__,<br>\n",
    "Traversal/Access is __O(logn)__,<br>\n",
    "Node search is __O(logn)__.<br>  \n",

    "There are three standard ways of traversing a binary tree:<br>\n",

    "__Preorder Traversal:__ Here the tree is traversed from root to left to right.  \n",
    "__Postorder Traversal:__ Here the tree is traversed from left to right to root.  \n",
    "For example, given __15__ as the root, __[12, 7, 5, 3]__ as the left from root and __[19, 23, 30, 29]__ as the right from the root, the tree can be traversed as follows;  \n",
    "Inorder-- [3, 5, 7, 12, 15, 19, 23, 29, 30].  \n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, there is no built-in implementation of a binary search tree. However, it can be implemented as a custom class.<br>\n",
    "As I mentioned earlier, the tree is made up of several nodes. Hence, we'll create a `Node` class and defined some functions which will be used to manipulate the prospective tree.  \n",

    "Earlier, I mentioned that each node has two children(left and right). The `__init__` function of the above `Node` class takes note of that.  \n",
    "Now, how does this `Node` class work. I'll explain each function step by step.  \n",
    "However, to understand the operations and nuances in this `Node` class, one must have a good grasp of __Recursion__.  \n",
    "Let's go over the `Node` class function after function...\n",
    "###### `addChild`\n",
    "Initially, the function checks if the child to be added is equal to the root node; if so, it does nothing. This is to avoid duplicants in the tree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the function checks if the prospective child is less than the current node; if so, every other operation of adding the new child is done in the left subtree. Now, the function checks if the left subtree exists; if so, the `addChild` method is recursively called on the left subtree.  \n",
    "Finally, if the left subtree does not exist, the new child become the left subtree of the current node.<br>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if the prospective child is greater than the root node, every other operation is done on the right subtree. The `addChild` method is recursively called until the right subtree does not exist, then the child subsequently becomes the right subtree of that current node.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__NB:__ The entire function is following the __BST__ order: nodes less than the current node are directed to the left subtree and nodes greater are directed to the right subtree.\n",
    "###### `remove`\n",
    "Initially, the function checks if the item(node) to be removed is less than the current node; if so, then the item(node) can be found in the left subtree.  \n",
    "Then, the function checks it the left subtree exists; if so, the `remove` method is recursively called on the subsequent left subtree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if the item(node) to be added is greater than the current node, then the item(node) can be found in the right subtree. A check for the right subtree is also done and if it exists, the `remove` method is recursively called on the subsequent right subtree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on whether the item is greater or less than the current node, a particular path is followed.  \n",
    "The recursive operation is carried out following that path until it gets to a node which is not greater or less than the item to be deleted. Meaning that is the node that requires deletion.<br>  \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the function checks if the node to be deleted has any subtree; if it doesn't, it simply returns `None`.\n",
    "If the node has only a right tree, the right tree is returned. And if the right tree is also `None`, it'll be returned regardless.<br>  \n",
    "The final step is to balance the tree such that the __BST__ order is still maintained.  \n",
    "Here, the minimum value(node) in the right subtree of that node, is used to replace the node.  \n",
    "Then that value(node) is subsequently deleted from the right subtree to avoid duplicants.<br>  \n",
    "__NB:__ There are two ways of balancing the tree after a deletion. The minimum of the right subtree can be used to replace the current node, or the maximum of the left subtree is used instead. This way the __BST__ order is maintained.  \n",
    "###### `inOrder`\n",
    "This function simply follows the Inorder traversal. This means that the left subtree of a node is printed first, then the node itself is printed, then the right subtree of that node is finally printed. __\"in\"__ meaning between.  \n",
    "__NB:__ The entire operation is recursed.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### `preOrder`\n",
    "This function follows the Preorder traversal. Here, the base node is printed first followed by the left subtree and finally the right subtree.  \n",
    "__\"pre\"__ meaning before.  \n",
    "__NB:__ The entire operation is recursed.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### `postOrder`\n",
    "The Postorder traversal is observed in this case. The left subtree is printed first, then the right is next, finally the base node is printed.  \n",
    "__\"post\"__ meaning after.  \n",
    "__NB:__ The entire operation is recursed.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### `findMin`\n",
    "This is a utility function that simply returns the minimum value in the tree.  \n",
    "Following the __BST__ order, the minimum value will be the leftmost node in the tree.  \n",
    "So, the function recursively calls the `findMin` on the left subtree, till it gets to a node that doesn't have a left subtree.  \n",
    "Then it returns that node, because it is the leftmost node.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### `findMax`\n",
    "This is a utility function that simply returns the maximum value in the tree.  \n",
    "Following the __BST__ order, the maximum value will be the rightmost node in the tree.  \n",
    "The `findMax` function is recursed on the right subtree until it gets to a node that doesn't have a right subtree.  \n",
    "Then it returns that node, because it is the rightmost node.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### `calcSum`\n",
    "This is also a utility function used to calculate the sum of all the nodes in the tree.  \n",
    "The sum of the entire tree will be, the __(left subtree + node + right subtree)__. In every node of the tree, this sum operation has to be done and returned to get the sum of the entire tree. This is done recursively by calling the `calcSum` method on the left and right subtrees each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### `search`\n",
    "This is a boolean method which returns True or False depending on whether a node exists or not.  \n",
    "Initially, the function checks if the supplied item(node) is the root node; if so, it returns True.<br>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Else, if the item is less than the root node, then it has to be in the left subtree. A check is done to make sure the left tree exists; if does, the `search` method is recursed, if it doesn't, it returns False, meaning the item(node) is not in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if the item is greater than the root node, then it has to be in the right subtree.   \n",
    "Then, the function checks if the right subtree exists; if does, the `search` method is recursed, if it doesn't, it returns False, meaning the item(node) is not in the tree.<br>  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Apparently, all the methods in this `Node` class involves a recursive operation.  \n",
    "This recursive operation is possible because, the left subtree(child) and right subtree(child) of any node in the tree is also an instance of the `Node` class.<br>  \n",
