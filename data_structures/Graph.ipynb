    "A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a defined number of vertices and edges.  \n",
    "These vertices are the nodes that make up the graph and the edges are the lines/arc that connect any two nodes.  \n",
    "In one sentence, a graph data structured can be defined as a set of vertices(V) and a set of edges(E). Thus a graph can be represented as __G(E, V)__.<br>\n",
    "There are numerous variants of the graph data structure, like, __Finite graph, Infinite graph, Trivial graph, Simple graph, Multi graph, Null graph, Pseudo graph,__ to mention a few.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some use cases of a graph data structure include;<br>\n",
    "Social networking platforms(users are nodes and their connections are edges),<br>\n",

    "A graph is a recursive data structure. This means that, most of the processess in manipulating a graph involves some sort of recursive operations.  \n",
    "So, to fully comprehend the graph data structure, one must have quite an understanding of __Recursion__.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__NB:__ One can  come to a logical conclusion that the graph data structure is like a network or link to things, people, places, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there's no built-in implementation of the graph data structure. However, it can be implemented as a custom class.  \n",
    "Hence, we'll define a class to implemeting the graph data structure. Let's get to it...."

    "The `__init__` function of the above class properly defines a dictionary that can be used to represent the connections in the prospective graph. This will make much more sense when we implement this.  \n",

    "__Finally__, we go through the linked points of the valid starting point as defined in the pre-initialised dictionary and append them to the `links` array until we get to the ending point. This is a recursive operation; meaning that for each linked point, the same `get_links` function is called until it gets to the ending point. __Recursion__ is a very important aspect to grasp this.\n",

    "###### `shortest_link`\n",
    "This function returns the shortest link from a particular point to another point. It is quite similar to `get_links` function and also involves a recursive operation.  \n",
    "A very easy way to define this function will be to just call the `get_links` function and return the link with the lowest `len()`. However, I've decided to take a more standard approach.  \n",
    "__First__, the function checks if the starting point is in the ending point; if so, it returns the starting point for obvious reasons.  \n",
    "__Then__, it checks if the `start` is a valid starting point in the graph; if it isn't, then it returns None.  \n",
    "__Similarly__, we go through the linked points of the valid starting point as defined in the pre-initialised dictionary, However, while appending these links, we use a comparison operator to compare the pre-existing `short_link` with the new found link. Then, we append the appropriate one depending on which is less.  \n",
    "Also, this process is recursed. Each linked point also call the `shortest_link` function.  \n",
